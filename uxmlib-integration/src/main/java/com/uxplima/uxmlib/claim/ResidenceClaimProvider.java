/**
 * {@link ClaimProvider} backed by Residence, reached <b>entirely by reflection</b>. There is no compile
 * dependency on Residence, so this class loads and runs whether or not Residence is present. Here a "claim" is
 * a residence: the block belongs to a claim exactly when Residence reports a residence covering it, so a warp
 * can be gated to a residence you own or have build rights in.
 *
 * <p>The lookup is {@code Residence.getResidenceManager().getByLoc(Location)}, which returns {@code null} in
 * unclaimed space or a non-Residence world; a {@code null} residence reads as unclaimed and {@link #claimAt}
 * returns empty, so unclaimed land stays free. A covering residence is mapped to the port's owner/trust model
 * against Residence's owner-name and build-flag concepts.
 *
 * <p>Residence is <b>name-keyed</b>, not UUID-keyed: a residence records its owner as a name
 * ({@code ClaimedResidence.getOwner()}) and grants access by name ({@code ResidencePermissions.playerHas(name,
 * flag, def)}). The port hands us a {@link UUID}, so every lookup first resolves that UUID to the server-known
 * name via {@code server.getOfflinePlayer(uuid).getName()}. That read consults the local user cache and is
 * safe on the region thread for a player the server has seen; for a UUID it has never seen the name is
 * {@code null}, which we treat as "no match": an unknown player is neither owner nor trusted.
 *
 * <p>Ownership is the resolved name matching the residence owner name, compared case-insensitively because
 * Residence itself compares owner names that way. Trust widens ownership to anyone the residence grants the
 * {@code build} flag, matching the owner-or-member reading the other providers use.
 *
 * <p>{@link ClaimLookup#owner()} stays empty: Residence exposes only a name, and resolving a name back to a
 * UUID for an offline player is unreliable, so there is no dependable single owner UUID to hand back, callers
 * gate on {@link ClaimLookup#isOwner(UUID)} instead, as they do for WorldGuard. Residence has no per-player ban
 * list (access is governed by the ambiguous {@code move} flag, which cannot be told apart from a global deny)
 * so {@link ClaimLookup#isBanned} is always {@code false}, matching WorldGuard's lack of a ban concept.
 *
 * <p>{@link #active()} consults only the plugin manager, so constructing this provider and asking whether it is
 * active names no {@code com.bekvon} type: a server without Residence loads none of its classes. The Residence
 * API chain runs lazily inside {@link #claimAt} past that guard, and any reflective failure logs once and
 * degrades to empty rather than propagating.
