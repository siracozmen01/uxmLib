/**
 * The handle the engine hands a menu action so a click can drive the very window it fired in — repaint the whole
 * menu, repaint one slot, or reset it to the first page — rather than only touching the world outside it. The
 * {@link MenuListener} binds a real one to the clicked {@link MenuHolder} and threads it onto the
 * {@link MenuActionContext}; every operation runs through the same viewer's-entity-thread hop and the same repaint
 * path a pagination click uses, so a control action never touches the inventory off the viewer's region thread and
 * never opens a second window.
 *
 * <p>A context built outside a live click — a unit test, or a feature invoking a binding directly — carries
 * {@link #NOOP} instead, so a {@code refresh}/{@code reset} there is a harmless no-op rather than a null
 * dereference. That is what keeps the four-argument {@link MenuActionContext} constructor (the one every existing
 * call-site uses) safe without change.
 *
 * <p>Engine-internal: it lives in {@code runtime/} and is only ever produced by the listener and consumed by the
 * sibling {@code vocab/} action pack, both inside the engine.
