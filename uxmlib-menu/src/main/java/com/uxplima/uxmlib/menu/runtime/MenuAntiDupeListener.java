/**
 * Strips escaped menu display items from a player's real inventory, the persistence/escape half of the anti-dupe
 * defence. The engine already cancels every click on a menu window, so a display item should never leave the top
 * inventory in the first place; this listener is the safety net for the paths a cancel-all cannot cover (a plugin
 * conflict, a crash with a menu open, or the item being written to the player file at shutdown) where a {@link
 * MenuItemMark marked} tile could end up in a genuine inventory and be duplicated. It is a separate listener from
 * {@link MenuListener} on purpose: the anti-dupe is a distinct safety concern, not part of the one-listener menu click-
 * routing invariant (the same separation {@link LastMenuCleanupListener} keeps for its own cleanup).
 *
 * <p>Only items carrying the menu mark are ever removed, and only from the player's <em>own</em> inventory: never the
 * closing menu window (which is discarded anyway). A real inventory of genuine items is left byte-identical because
 * genuine items are never marked; a menu tile is marked on a display copy, so the mark reliably distinguishes an
 * escaped copy from something the player owns. Both events fire on the player's own region/event thread, and the sweep
 * reads and writes only that player's inventory, so it is Folia-safe inline with no scheduler hop.
