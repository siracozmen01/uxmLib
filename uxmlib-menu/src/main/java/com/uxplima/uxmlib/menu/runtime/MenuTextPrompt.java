/**
 * The narrow capability the menu engine's {@code input:} step uses to capture a line of text without depending on the
 * concrete text-input seam: it hands over a viewer, an input-point key (the operator's per-key anvil/chat/sign mode is
 * looked up by it), a resolved prompt label and an optional pre-fill, and gets exactly one callback back — the typed
 * line on submit, or {@code onCancel}. Production wires it over {@code TextInput.promptResolved}; a test wires a
 * synchronous fake. Defined here so {@code MenuListener} stays decoupled from the input package and testable without
 * constructing the whole seam.
 *
 * <p>The implementation is responsible for delivering both callbacks on the viewer's entity thread, exactly as the
 * text-input seam already does, so the engine's continuation runs where it can safely touch the player and reopen a
 * menu.
