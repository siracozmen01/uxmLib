/**
 * A block of {@link Requirement}s bound to a click gesture, plus how many of them must pass and what to run when the
 * block fails. It is the pure model behind the config grammar {@code left { click = [...], requirements = [...],
 * minimum = N, deny = [...] }}: the {@code requirements} are the gates, {@code minimum} is how many must hold, and
 * {@code deny} is the action list the runtime fires instead of the click's own actions when the gate fails.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #minimum} yields the three common combinators without a separate flag:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code minimum <= 0} or {@code minimum >= requirements.size()}: ALL must pass (AND).</li>
 *   <li>{@code minimum == 1}: ANY may pass (OR).</li>
 *   <li>otherwise: at least N of the M must pass (N-of-M).</li>
 * </ul>
 * {@link #effectiveMinimum()} folds those rules into the concrete count a pass tally is compared against, and
 * {@link #satisfiedBy(int, boolean)} makes the comparison, so no caller carries the combinator itself. A caller
 * decides only which individual requirements hold, which is the part that needs a condition registry.
 *
 * <p>{@code stopAtSuccess} short-circuits evaluation once the {@link #minimum} is met: the runtime stops evaluating
 * further requirements (and stops running their per-requirement actions) as soon as enough have passed. It only means
 * anything with a positive {@code minimum}, with the default AND minimum every requirement must be looked at anyway,
 * and it defaults to {@code false}, so a block that does not ask for it evaluates every requirement exactly as before.
 *
 * <p>Pure by design: which requirements actually pass is decided by the caller (it holds the condition registry);
 * this record only says how they combine, so it stays Bukkit-free for plain-JUnit testing. {@link #NONE} is the empty
 * block that always passes and denies nothing: the value a gesture with no requirement block resolves to.
 *
 * <p>The same block also backs an item's {@code view} visibility gate: {@link #allOf(List)} lifts a flat list of
 * condition refs into an all-mandatory AND block (the historic view grammar), and {@link #passes(Predicate)} is the
 * pure yes/no a view gate needs, so an item can now gate visibility on a minimum (OR / N-of-M) or an inverted
 * condition without any new model: the click path and the view path share one requirement block.
