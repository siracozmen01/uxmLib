/**
 * The per-open state of an editor menu, parked on its {@link MenuHolder} on the editor path only. Where a spec
 * menu re-derives its slots from a {@link com.uxplima.uxmlib.menu.spec.MenuSpec},
 * an editor re-derives its property buttons from the {@code EditorSpec} and the live subject the properties close
 * over, so the holder carries the spec and subject here and the editor renderer re-reads the property list fresh on
 * every draw, which is what makes an edited value show without a reopen.
 *
 * <p>It also owns the slot routing for one draw. A property slot maps to its {@link EditableProperty}; the click
 * listener consults {@link #propertyAt} to route a click there into {@link EditableProperty#onClick} with a freshly
 * built click context. A plain button (back, delete) maps to a {@link Runnable} the listener runs as-is on the
 * viewer's entity thread. Keeping these maps off the spec {@code clickMap} is what lets the one listener tell an
 * editor button from a spec item without forcing an editor's typed property onto a {@code RenderedSlot}, which
 * carries a spec item an editor button has none of.
 *
 * <p>The {@code spec} is held as {@link Object} so this runtime class needs no compile dependency on the public
 * {@code EditorSpec} façade type (the editor renderer, which already depends on that type, casts it back) and the
 * {@code runtime}→{@code menu} package edge stays acyclic. The subject is the same nullable domain object
 * {@link MenuContext} carries, repeated here only so the property-list provider can be re-applied without reaching
 * back through the context.
