/**
 * The callback the engine routes a grid content-slot click to. It is handed the {@link GridView} for the open window
 * (so the consumer can repaint after a mutation), the live {@link Player} the engine already re-resolved on the
 * viewer's entity thread (so the consumer can message them or open a child window), the <em>menu</em> slot the click
 * resolved to (the absolute slot in the edited menu, already un-paged by the engine's {@code menuSlot = canvasSlot +
 * page*pageSize} math), whether that slot currently holds an item, and the click gesture. The engine makes no editing
 * decision of its own (placing, moving, clearing and opening a sub-editor are all the consumer's policy) it only
 * translates a raw canvas click into this un-paged, filled-or-empty call.
