/**
 * The click callbacks a caller hands {@link Menus#openGrid}: the behaviour half of a grid open, kept separate from the
 * {@link GridSpec} layout half so the same visual canvas can be driven by different editing policy. Every grid carries
 * a content-slot handler for its editor gestures; a grid may additionally carry a {@link GridCaptureHandler}, which
 * makes it "capture-enabled": the operator can then drag or place one of their own items straight onto a content cell
 * (or shift-click it out of their inventory) and the engine stamps a copy of its definition into the slot instead of
 * blanket-cancelling the click. A grid with a {@code null} capture handler stays blanket-cancelled like every other
 * menu, so the control-bar buttons and the prev/next pagination on the {@link GridSpec} are unaffected either way.
