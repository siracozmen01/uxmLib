 * The pure slot arithmetic behind a bottom-inventory menu, where a menu paints items into the viewer's own 36
 * inventory slots shown below the chest top. In a chest {@code InventoryView} the top occupies raw slots
 * {@code 0..topSize-1} and the player's own inventory follows in raw slots {@code topSize..topSize+35}. Bukkit's
 * player-inventory convention orders those 36 as the 27 main-storage slots first (player slots 9..35) then the 9
 * hotbar slots (player slots 0..8), so a raw offset must be re-mapped to reach the right {@code PlayerInventory}
 * index. Kept here as plain math, free of any Bukkit type, so the mapping is unit-testable without a server and the
 * menu engine's pure-core fence stays green.
