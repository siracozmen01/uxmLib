/**
 * One page of rows plus the size of the whole filtered corpus. The total is what lets the engine render
 * a page count and decide whether a next-page button applies, without ever holding more than a page.
 *
 * <p>{@code pinned} rows claim a fixed content slot through {@link PinnedEntry} and sit outside the page's flow:
 * a sponsored entry that must appear on every page, for instance. They are not counted in {@code totalCount}.
 *
 * <p>A page has a fixed capacity: because pinned entries occupy content slots too, {@code rows.size() + pinned.size()}
 * must not exceed the {@code size} the {@link PageRequest} asked for. A source that returns more than fits has the
 * overflow dropped by the engine, which logs it at warn rather than discarding it silently.
 *
 * <p>Not to be confused with {@code Pagination.Page}, which is the engine's slot-placement result for an
 * in-memory list. This type is the data a source returns; that type is where the renderer puts it.
