/**
 * The custom-head capability the menu engine asks for and never provides. A host that runs HeadDatabase hands the
 * engine a real one; a host that does not hands it {@link #NONE}, and neither has to tell the engine which it did. A
 * skull icon can name a HeadDatabase head by id (the {@code hdb:<id>} skull source); this seam resolves that id to its
 * {@link ItemStack}. When HeadDatabase is absent the whole capability is the no-op {@link #NONE}: the lookup returns
 * empty and the skull provider falls back to a plain player head, so a menu referencing an HDB head still renders on a
 * server that does not run HeadDatabase.
 *
 * <p>A lookup is best-effort by design. An unknown id, a HeadDatabase that has not yet finished loading its head index
 * (it builds the index asynchronously on startup, so an early read can come back empty), or a reflective read that
 * fails all collapse to {@link Optional#empty()} rather than throwing: a head lookup degrades to the plain-head
 * fallback, it never breaks a menu render. A null or blank id is empty as well.
 *
 * <p>The lookup touches the item on the calling thread with no I/O, so a caller invokes it on the viewer's entity
 * thread: the menu engine's item-build chain already runs there. This interface and its {@link #NONE} default reference
 * none of {@code me.arcaniax}; the only class that may touch HeadDatabase is the implementation a host injects, and
 * that one is expected to reach it by reflection past a plugin-present guard. So a HeadDatabase-less server loads no
 * SDK class through this seam.
