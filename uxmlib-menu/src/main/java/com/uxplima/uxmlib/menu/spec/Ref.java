/**
 * A parsed reference to engine behaviour: an action, condition, placeholder, or list source the registries
 * later resolve by {@link #id()}. A reference carries optional string arguments so a spec can write a single
 * compact token instead of a HOCON block.
 *
 * <p>An action ref also carries optional per-action modifiers: a {@code delayTicks} the runtime waits before it
 * fires, a {@code chance} (percent) that gates whether it fires at all, and a {@code deny} fallback ref the
 * runtime runs instead when the chance roll fails. These only mean anything on the action path; a condition,
 * placeholder, or list-source ref parses with the no-modifier defaults (no delay, always fires, no fallback) and
 * ignores them.
 *
 * <p>An {@code input:}/{@code confirm:} action ref additionally carries a {@link Continuation}: a step whose outcome
 * arrives on a later callback, so it splits the gesture's action chain rather than running inline. Every other ref
 * carries an empty {@code continuation}, so it dispatches exactly as before.
