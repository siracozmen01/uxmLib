/**
 * The callback the engine routes a <em>capture</em> to on a capture-enabled grid: the operator drags or places one of
 * their own items onto a content cell, or shift-clicks one out of their inventory onto the canvas. Unlike {@link
 * GridClickHandler}, which fires for an editor gesture (pick up, move, clear, open the sub-editor), this fires only
 * when a real item's definition is being stamped into a slot. The engine has already cancelled the underlying event, so
 * the operator's real item never moves: {@code copy} is a defensive clone of it, and the consumer's job is to record
 * its definition into the edited model (typically a serialized token) and repaint. Because nothing is ever transferred
 * into or out of the top inventory, no duplicate can be produced.
 *
 * <p>Handed the {@link GridView} for the open window (so the consumer can repaint after mutating its model), the live
 * {@link Player} the engine re-resolved on the viewer's entity thread, the <em>menu</em> slot the capture maps to
 * (already un-paged by the engine), and a clone of the captured item. A grid opened with a non-null capture handler on
 * its {@link GridHandlers} is "capture-enabled"; one opened without stays blanket-cancelled like every other menu.
