/**
 * The Layer-1 export the in-game menu editor's action / condition / placeholder / list-source pickers render from: the
 * sorted id catalog each of the four {@link MenuBindings} registries actually holds. It is the single source a picker
 * reads, so an author is offered exactly the bindings that are wired: nothing the engine cannot resolve.
 *
 * <p>The registries hold only an id → handler map, with no per-id argument schema, so this export carries no invented
 * arg descriptions: every ref an editor builds is a bare id or an {@code id:value} token, the value entered as free
 * text. The placeholder catalog lists only the exactly-registered tokens; the open-ended prefix families ({@code
 * papi_*}, {@code data_*}) claim ids by predicate, so they cannot be enumerated and are left to a typed token.
 *
 * @param actionIds every registered action id, sorted
 * @param conditionIds every registered condition id, sorted
 * @param placeholderIds every exactly-registered placeholder id, sorted
 * @param listSourceIds every registered list-source id, sorted
