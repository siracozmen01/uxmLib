 * than the engine's click-kind enum. A single-gesture button (an enum option, the add button, the back button)
 * ignores both flags; a list-entry button branches on them (left moves up, right moves down, shift-left
 * edits, shift-right removes) without ever seeing an {@code InventoryClickEvent}.
 *
 * <p>Passing the gesture as the property model's own booleans — not the engine's {@code ClickKind} — is what keeps
 * the property package decoupled from the menu engine: the engine maps its click kind down to these two booleans when
 * it invokes a button, so neither this type nor any property ever names an engine class.
