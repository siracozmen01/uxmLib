/**
 * Fired just before a menu opens for a viewer, at the single choke-point every open funnels through — a fresh open,
 * a {@code back} step, or a reopen-last. Another plugin can cancel it to veto the open: a cancelled event shows the
 * viewer neither a chest nor a native Bedrock form. An uncancelled event is the default, so a menu with no listener
 * opens exactly as before.
 *
 * <p>The event fires on the viewer's own region thread (the thread the engine opens the window on), which on Folia is
 * that entity's region rather than a single main thread. A listener must therefore respect Folia threading: it may
 * read the payload and cancel freely, but any world or entity work it triggers must be scheduled onto the owning
 * region, not run inline against another region's state.
