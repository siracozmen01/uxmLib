/**
 * The audible half of a menu click. A button that reacts silently reads as a button that did nothing, so the engine
 * gives every gesture it accepts a short sound: a click for an ordinary action, a page turn for pagination, and a low
 * note for a refusal. The tones are the ones the style canon fixes, so every menu across every module sounds the same
 * without a spec having to say so.
 *
 * <p>The sound is feedback, never content: a gesture the engine ignored (a filler pane, a slot with no bound action)
 * stays silent, and a spec that plays its own {@code sound:} effect on that gesture wins, so an operator who wants a
 * cash register on a purchase button gets exactly that instead of two overlapping sounds.
 *
 * <p>Volumes sit low on purpose. A menu is clicked far more often than anything else in the game, and a loud click
 * turns a browsing session into noise.
