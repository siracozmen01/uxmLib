/**
 * A whole menu parsed from its HOCON spec: a title, a row count, its refresh policy, the requirement that gates
 * opening, the actions run on open and close, the items keyed by their spec id, an optional non-chest inventory
 * shape, and the menu's own custom placeholder definitions. Validated up front so the renderer can trust the row
 * count and slot bounds without re-checking.
 *
 * <p>The {@code inventoryType} is carried as a plain operator token: {@code "hopper"}, {@code "dispenser"}, and so
 * on, never a Bukkit {@code InventoryType}, so this model stays pure and plain-JUnit testable. Absent, the menu is
 * the default {@code rows}-based chest. When present, the Bukkit-side façade maps the token to a real inventory
 * shape and falls back to a {@code rows}-based chest if that shape rejects a custom window, which is why {@code rows}
 * and its {@code 1..6} bound are still validated even for a non-chest menu: they size that fallback.
 *
 * <p>The {@code placeholders} map is the menu's own {@code placeholders {}} block: {@code name -> template} pairs
 * that define custom {@code %name%} tokens scoped to this one menu. It is carried verbatim for the Bukkit-side
 * renderer to expand, and is resolved local-first: a menu-scoped token overrides the shared registry (built-ins,
 * data readers, the global custom-placeholder file) for this menu alone. Empty for a menu that declares no block, so
 * such a menu renders byte-identically to before this field existed.
 *
 * <p>The {@code clickCooldownMs} is the menu's own {@code click-cooldown} anti-spam window in milliseconds: two
 * clicks landing closer together than this are treated as one, so a spam-click can't double-fire an item's actions.
 * A value of {@code 0} means the menu sets no window of its own and defers to the server-wide default, so a menu
 * that declares no key behaves exactly as before.
 *
 * <p>The {@code bottomInventory} flag turns the menu into a 90-slot canvas: beyond the chest top it may also place
 * items into the viewer's own 36 inventory slots, addressed as raw slots {@code rows*9 .. rows*9+35}. The Bukkit-side
 * runtime snapshots and restores the player inventory around such a menu; here it only widens the slot-fit bound, and
 * a bottom-inventory menu is chest-only by construction (the raw-slot geometry only holds for a chest). A menu that
 * leaves the flag {@code false}, the default, validates and renders exactly as before.
 *
 * <p>The {@code chestOnly} flag keeps the menu on the chest render path even for a Bedrock viewer the hybrid form
 * renderer would otherwise redirect. A form is a flat button list, so a menu that displays or edits real item stacks
 * (the inventory viewer, a storage-style grid) cannot be represented as one; setting this flag opts such a menu out
 * of the redirect so its Bedrock viewers still get the chest. It is purely a routing hint here: a plain boolean the
 * Bukkit-side façade reads, so this model stays pure and plain-JUnit testable. A menu that leaves it {@code false},
 * the default: is redirected to a form for a Bedrock viewer and renders exactly as before for a Java one.
 *
 * <p>The {@code contents} map is the menu's {@code content {}} block: the slot regions the engine hands to a
 * feature's {@code ContentProvider} instead of drawing itself, keyed by the provider id each region names. Empty for
 * every menu that declares no block, which is every menu drawn entirely from its own items, so such a menu renders
 * and routes clicks exactly as before this block existed.
 *
 * <p>The {@code bedrock} block is the menu's optional {@code bedrock {}} native CustomForm: when present, a Bedrock
 * viewer opening the menu (and not opted out by {@code chestOnly}) gets that explicit form: the form-native
 * dropdown/slider/toggle/multi-input widgets the automatic SimpleForm degradation cannot express: instead of the
 * degraded button list. It is {@link Optional#empty()} for a menu that declares no block, in which case the automatic
 * degradation is unchanged; a Java viewer never sees it either way. Purely spec here: a value the Bukkit-side façade
 * reads, so this model stays pure and plain-JUnit testable.
