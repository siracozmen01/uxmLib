/**
 * One editable field in an {@link com.uxplima.uxmlib.menu.EntityEditorView}: the description of a single button (its
 * label, the lore line that reports the current value, and its icon) plus the behaviour run when the viewer clicks it.
 * The editor draws one button per property at its configured slot and routes a click on that slot back to {@link
 * #onClick(PropertyClick)}.
 *
 * <p>A property carries no domain logic of its own. Its {@link #onClick} performs a presentation step (cycle a flag,
 * open an anvil, step a number, open a sub-selector) and then hands the new value to a caller-supplied setter (a {@code
 * Consumer} that calls the module's existing application use case). The framework is the inbound adapter; the use case
 * is the only place the change is actually made, so the GUI and the equivalent command always go through the same code.
 *
 * <p>Implementations are canon-styled (label/value text via {@link String} catalog entries), schedule any write off the
 * tick thread through the shared {@code Scheduler}, and gate destructive steps behind a confirm. The supplied set is
 * {@link ToggleProperty}, {@link TextProperty}, {@link NumberProperty}, {@link EnumProperty}, and {@link ListProperty};
 * a module composes them, it does not subclass them.
