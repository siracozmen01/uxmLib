/**
 * The pure, Bukkit-free type model for the data-driven menu engine. These records mirror the shape of a menu's
 * HOCON spec, references, slot sets, item decoration, click handling, and the menu itself, so the loader can
 * parse a spec into immutable values that the renderer and runtime consume without ever touching the file
 * again. Nothing here imports {@code org.bukkit} or {@code net.minecraft}, so the model stays unit-testable in
 * isolation. That boundary is held by {@code ArchitectureTest.theMenuModelTouchesNoPlatform}, which fails the build
 * on the first import rather than on the first surprise.
