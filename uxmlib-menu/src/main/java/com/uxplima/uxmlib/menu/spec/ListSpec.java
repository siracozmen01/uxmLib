 * A list-backed item: the engine asks the {@code source} reference for a collection of entries and stamps the

 *
 * <p>{@code pageSize} and {@code sorts} are the knobs a paged source reads to page and order its corpus down at the
 * store rather than in memory. A {@code pageSize} of {@code 0} means "derive the page from the item's slot count",
 * which is the historic behaviour every in-memory list still gets; {@code sorts} is the ordered list of sort keys a
 * paged source offers (empty means its default order). Both are inert for a plain in-memory source, which hands its
 * whole corpus over for the engine to slice: the binding validator rejects a spec that sets them there so the
 * mismatch is a loud configuration error rather than a knob that silently does nothing.
