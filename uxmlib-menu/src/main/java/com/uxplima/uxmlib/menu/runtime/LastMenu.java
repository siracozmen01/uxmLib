/**
 * Per-player history of the custom menus each viewer has opened, so {@code /menu last} can reopen the current one and a
 * {@code back} button can step to the previous one. Only a subject-less menu (a disk-loaded custom menu) is ever
 * recorded; a feature menu carries a live domain subject that must not be reopened blind, and it has its own command,
 * so the engine deliberately never remembers one here.
 *
 * <p>Each player owns a bounded stack, newest on top. {@link #record} pushes an open onto it, but a consecutive
 * identical open (the same menu/page/arguments: a refresh, or reopening the window already on top) is de-duplicated
 * rather than stacked, and the stack is capped at {@link #MAX_DEPTH}, evicting the oldest entry so a player who wanders
 * through many menus cannot grow it without bound. {@link #get} peeks the top (the current open): what {@code /menu
 * last} reopens. {@link #back} pops the top and returns the new top (the previous open), or empty when nothing remains
 * below; the previous then becomes the current, so a further {@code back} steps further. {@link #clear} drops a
 * player's whole history on quit so the map never retains an offline player.
 *
 * <p>Bukkit-free (only {@code java.util}) and thread-safe: the backing map is a {@link ConcurrentHashMap} and every
 * read and mutation of a player's deque runs inside a {@code compute}/{@code computeIfPresent} remapping, which the map
 * executes atomically per key. Because {@link ArrayDeque} is not itself thread-safe, routing every access through that
 * per-key lock is what keeps a {@code record} on the viewer's entity thread and a {@code clear} on the quit thread from
 * corrupting the same deque.
