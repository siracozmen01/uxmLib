/**
 * The per-open state of a selector child window, parked on its {@link MenuHolder} on the selector path only. Where a
 * spec menu routes a click through its {@code clickMap}, an editor through its {@link EditorState}, and a confirm
 * through its {@link ConfirmState}, a selector routes through this: each option slot maps to the choose action drawn
 * there, and the listener consults {@link #chooseAt} to find the one the player clicked. Keeping these actions here
 * (off the spec {@code clickMap} and off the editor maps) is what lets the one listener tell a selector apart from the
 * other three menu kinds without giving any of them a slot it has no item for.
 *
 * <p>Clicking a button closes the window and runs its handler, which reopens the parent editor, or for a list
 * child reopens the list itself after a mutation. So a single-fire guard is belt-and-braces against a stray second click
 * arriving in the same tick before the close lands: {@link #fire} flips the guard and reports whether this is the first
 * click, so the listener runs a handler at most once even if it is clicked twice. Each handler receives the click
 * gesture, so a list-entry button can branch on left/right/shift while an option/add/back button ignores it.
