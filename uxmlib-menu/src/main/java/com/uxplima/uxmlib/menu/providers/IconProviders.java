/**
 * The ordered chain of {@link IconProvider}s the renderer consults before falling back to a plain material.
 * {@link #resolve} hands the spec to each provider in turn and returns the first non-empty icon; an empty
 * result from every provider means no provider claimed the spec, so the renderer treats it as a material name.
 *
 * <p>Two shapes are wired at the composition root. {@link #defaults()} carries only the providers that need no
 * external plugin — the raw-entry stack provider, skull sources and viewer equipment — and is what the plain
 * {@code ItemRenderer(GuiText, PlaceholderRegistry)} constructor uses, so every existing call site gains those
 * for free.
 * {@link #withHeadDatabase(HeadQuery)} additionally chains the HeadDatabase provider, built from the Phase-0
 * {@link HeadQuery} hook; bootstrap uses it so {@code hdb:<id>} resolves when HeadDatabase is installed and
 * degrades to a plain head (the material fallback) when it is not. {@link #full(Server, Log, HeadQuery)} is the
 * composition root's full chain: those same providers plus the six custom-item integrations (ItemsAdder,
 * Oraxen, Nexo, CraftEngine, MMOItems, ExecutableItems), each reached reflectively and degrading to the material
 * fallback when its plugin is absent.
 *
 * <p>The built-in chain is immutable, but the composition root may opt a chain into a live {@link
 * IconProviderRegistry} via {@link #withRuntime}: a plugin then registers its own {@link IconProvider} through the
 * public {@code MenuApi} and {@link #resolve} consults the runtime registry <em>after</em> every built-in, so a
 * registered provider adds new prefixes and can never shadow one of ours.
