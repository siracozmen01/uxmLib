/**
 * The per-open state of a two-button confirm window, parked on its {@link MenuHolder} on the confirm path only.
 * Where a spec menu routes a click through its {@code clickMap} and an editor routes one through its
 * {@link EditorState}, a confirm routes through this: the yes slot maps to one decision runnable and the no slot to
 * another, and the listener consults {@link #decisionAt} to find the one the player clicked. Keeping the two
 * decisions here — off the spec {@code clickMap} and off the editor maps — is what lets the one listener tell a
 * confirm window apart from the other two without giving either a slot it has no item for.
 *
 * <p>The window closes on the first click, so a single-fire guard is belt-and-braces against a stray second click
 * arriving in the same tick before the close lands: {@link #fire} flips the guard and reports whether this is the
 * first decision, so the listener runs a handler at most once even if it is clicked twice.
