/**
 * One source of menu-item icons. A provider inspects the resolved {@code material} string a menu item declares and,
 * when it recognises that spec (by its own prefix ({@code skull:}, {@code hdb:}, …) or keyword ({@code helmet}, {@code
 * main_hand}, …)) returns the base {@link ItemStack} for it. When the spec is not one it owns, it returns {@link
 * Optional#empty()} so the next provider in the chain, and ultimately the renderer's plain-material fallback, gets a
 * turn. A provider therefore must match <em>only</em> its explicit prefixes/keywords and never a bare material name, so
 * an item declaring {@code DIAMOND} or {@code PLAYER_HEAD} is left for the material lookup and renders exactly as
 * before.
 *
 * <p>This is the extension point the later item-plugin integrations implement: an ItemsAdder, Oraxen, Nexo or MMOItems
 * provider claims its own prefix (e.g. {@code itemsadder:<id>}) over its plugin's API, falls back to empty when the
 * plugin is absent, and slots into the same {@link IconProviders} chain.
 *
 * <p>A provider resolves on the calling thread with no I/O and reads only the viewer's own state, so the renderer can
 * invoke it on the viewer's entity thread: Folia-safe, never blocking the main thread.
