/**
 * The capability a property uses to open its option/sub-menu picker as a menu-engine child window rather than a uxmLib
 * {@code SimpleGui}. It is defined here, in the property package, so a property depends only on this small port and not
 * on the engine that implements it; the engine supplies the implementation, keeping the property decoupled from the
 * runtime it opens into.
 *
 * <p>An opener receives everything the property already has: the viewer, a resolved title, the row count, the filler
 * material, and one {@link SelectorButton} per option, each an icon plus its choose action. It shows them as a child
 * window
 * the one menu listener routes and the one teardown owns. A button click runs its {@link SelectorButton#onChoose}
 * exactly once on the viewer's entity thread; closing the window without choosing runs nothing. The same capability
 * serves any property that opens a flat picker (the enum selector now, and the list and colour pickers as they migrate)
 * so each builds {@link SelectorButton}s and lets the engine paint and route them.
 *
 * <p>A property only ever opens a selector when its {@link ClickContext} carries an opener (the engine editor runtime
 * threads one in); a context with no opener (the legacy {@code EntityEditorView} path) leaves the property on its
 * uxmLib fallback, so both runtimes coexist while editors migrate.
