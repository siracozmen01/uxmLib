/**
 * The feature side of a menu's {@code content {}} region: what fills those slots, which movements the viewer may
 * make in them, and what becomes of whatever is left in them when the window closes. A feature registers one under
 * an id ({@code MenuBindings.content}), a spec names that id in its {@code content {}} block, and the engine does
 * the rest: it paints the region on every draw, routes its clicks here instead of to the spec's items, and hands
 * the final contents back on close.
 *
 * <p>This is the seam that lets a screen holding real item stacks (a trade offer, an inventory mirror, a kit's
 * contents) be laid out in a conf file: the frame, the buttons and the title are ordinary spec items an operator
 * re-skins, and only the live items stay in code, where the rules that stop an item being duplicated live.
 *
 * <p>Every method runs on the viewer's own entity thread, inside the click or close event, so an implementation
 * may read and write the open inventory directly but must not block.
