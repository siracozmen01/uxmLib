 * icon that ships its own lore.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #REPLACE}: the spec lore is the whole lore; the base's own lore is dropped. This is the historic
 *       behaviour and the default, so every existing menu renders unchanged.
 *   <li>{@link #APPEND}: the base's lore first, then the spec lore beneath it.
 *   <li>{@link #PREPEND}: the spec lore first, then the base's own lore beneath it.
